## Objectives
The goal of this project was to make an interactive trivia game based on the classic 90's sitcom Friends. The questions get progressively harder as the trivia game goes on. Once the trivia is over, the game should report back the results of the quiz and an option to retake the quiz should be available.

## User Stories
- As a player, I want to hit start to begin the trivia game.
- As a player, I want each slide to be the same format and organized
- As a player, I want to pick from four different options and be shown the correct answer
- As a player, I want my post game information available once I finish the trivia game

## Major Hurdles
- Properly formatting the game screen to be organized and functional.
- Accessing a single object to obtain the question, the four options and which answer was correct.
- Creating a game over modal that showed the user results.
- Separating the start, game and post-game screens.
- Resetting the entire game without having to refresh the browser.

## Future Work
- Add sound and a soundtrack to the game.
- Add a timer and automatic progression through the quiz.
- Create a high-score table.
- Add an easy, medium, hard difficulty selection mode.
